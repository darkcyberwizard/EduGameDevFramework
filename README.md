## Overview

This is a **web-based framework** designed to simplify the creation of educational games that teach technical concepts using engaging gameplay mechanics, based on **The XSS Game (https://github.com/darkcyberwizard/TheXSSGame)**.

The framework supports:

- **Multi-opposing-role gameplay**: Easily implement different roles to create competitive and collaborative scenarios. For instance, **Attacker**, **Defender**, and **User** could be used for a Cybersecurity educational game.
- **Interactive narrative-based simulations**: Build real-world inspired challenges to teach concepts in a safe and controlled environment.  
- **In-game feedback**: Integrate **Player Statboards**, badges, and multiple feedback types (confirmatory, explanatory, affirming, personalized) to motivate learners and reinforce learning.  

The framework runs fully in the browser ‚Äî no server-side dependencies are required. It provides reusable components, templates, and utilities to accelerate the development of educational games.

## Features

The framework includes pre-built modules for:

1. **Role-based gameplay**: Easily define multiple roles with unique objectives and interactions.  
2. **Simulation engine**: Script interactive challenges and branching narratives.  
3. **Feedback and statboards**: Implement multiple types of in-game feedback (affirming, explanatory, confirmatory, personalized) and track learner progress with badges, scores, and leaderboards.  
4. **Surveys and assessment**: Built-in support for pre- and post-game surveys to capture learner knowledge and motivation.  
5. **Extensibility**: Modular design allows developers to extend gameplay mechanics, feedback types, and analytics components.
